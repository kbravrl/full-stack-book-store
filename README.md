# full-stack-book-store

This is a full-stack web application built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** and **MySQL** for the backend. It allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, displaying, and deleting books, with each book having a title, description, price, and cover image.

## Features

- **View Books**: Users can view all books in a responsive, grid layout. Each book displays its cover image, title, description, and price.
- **Add New Books**: Users can add new books by providing a title, description, price, and cover image. The cover image is uploaded and stored with the book data.
- **Delete Books**: Users can delete books from the list, and the UI updates dynamically.
- **File Upload**: Book cover images are uploaded to the server and displayed alongside the book details.
